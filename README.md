Quick Apt (qapt)
-----------------

Quick Apt (qapt) uses Debian apt package manager to install and uninstall packages on your Ubuntu based Desktop.  Quick Apt keeps a record of every file that was originally place on your system at the time of install, and tries to remove (totally uninstall) all those files whenever you decide to uninstall that apt.  This way, your system is not filled overtime with unwanted remnants of programmes which should have been removed during the uninstall process.
